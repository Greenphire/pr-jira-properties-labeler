# Github Actions

This repository contains some custom Github actions.

## 1. Label Pull Request

This action allows you to add specific labels when a PR is opened. Also, the action is connected to Jira in order to retrieve
the priority of the feature using the issue code added in the PR title. You have to take into account that you need to listen to the `pull_request` event in order to use this action. Here you have an example:

```hcl
workflow "on pull request label it" {
  on = "pull_request"
  resolves = [
    "Label Pull Request"
  ]
}
```

### Usage:

```hcl
action "Label Pull Request" {
  uses = "xserrat/github-actions/action/label-pull-request@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN", "JIRA_ENCODED_TOKEN", "URI_JIRA"]
  env = {
    REVIEWERS = "maintainer1,maintainer2"
    REGEXP_FOR_JIRA_CODE_ON_PR_TITLE = "^([A-Z]{4}-[0-9]{4}).*"
    LABELS_ON_PULL_REQUEST_OPENED = "needs feedback"
  }
}
```

#### Secrets:

To add any secret to Github you need to go to `https://github.com/{username}/{repository}/settings/secrets` and add a new one.

* `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

It's a needed secret (THIS TOKEN IS FULFILLED AUTOMATICALLY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADD IT)

* `JIRA_ENCODED_TOKEN`:

It's the needed token to make requests to the JIRA api. This token is the combination in base64 of your user email to access
to your Jira and the API token created in the following section: 
`Your profile > Manage your account > Security > API Token: Create and manage API tokens > Create API token`

So, to obtain the `JIRA_ENCODED_TOKEN` you have to execute the following:
```bash
echo -n "your-email-for-jira-account:your-api-token" | base64
```

* `URI_JIRA`:
It's URI of Jira used to enter through the browser. Example: `mycompany.atlassian.net` or `mycompany.jira.com`

#### Environment variables:

To customize this action you have the following environment variables:

* `REVIEWERS`: The list of all maintainers to be added in the PR (separated by commas without spaces)

* `REGEXP_FOR_JIRA_CODE_ON_PR_TITLE`: The regular expression to obtain the Jira issue code from the pull request title.
In the example we have a code like: "**ABCD-1234** Feature to make something". The issue code is used to retrieve the priority of the issue from Jira and add it as a label in order to prioritize the code review.

* `LABELS_ON_PULL_REQUEST_OPENED`: List of labels that will be added to the PR when opened.
